ITSPR ComputerArch/ProggramableSystems simplified

This remote repository has been made to help other students around the world
with a topic called "Computer Architecture" or "Proggrammable Systems" in English
and "Arquitectura de computadoras" ó "Sistemas Programables" en español.

All of these file were made in assembly using the microcontroller PIC16F887A except for one
which was made in c format.

I'll try to keep these up-to-date adding new files or better commenting my codes!

Hope it is some help for you.
